2021-05-04: project paused while I learn more about scraping dynamic web pages.

# Introduction
While I was living in Berkeley, there were two vegetarian pizza options that I really enjoyed and were close to where I worked: Cheese Board and Sliver.
They each both only offer one type of pizza each day, and these pizzas change from week to week. Now that I'm back in school for computer science, I thought:
"Wouldn't it have been great if I had something that gave me their menus for the week so I could plan if I wanted to go?".

# Motivation
* I want to learn more about web scraping

# User Stories
* As a user, I want to be notified at the beginning of the menu options for each restaurant.
* As a user, I want to be notified by email.

# Technologies
* Java 11
* Web scraping using JSoup 1.13.1
